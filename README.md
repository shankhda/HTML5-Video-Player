# HTML5-Video-Player

This app is basically a simple browser embedded video player.
Funtionality includes:
Play/pause, seek, mute/unmute, change volume, replay and fullscreen.

# Motivation
As a part of one of my web development classes, we were asked to make ourselves familiar with HTML5 audio and video tags. While reading up on the DOM references of the video tag, I realized that with all the methods and events provided, a custom video player could easily be created.

# Technology used
HTML5, CSS, Javascript

# Credits
http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/ --> This site was used to generate gradient applied on the overlapping pause screen
https://videos.pexels.com/ --> Site used to find stock videos to test

# Limitation
The video currently being used as a sample does not have any audio. I could not find stock video with sound hence all the volume and mute related tests were conducted on personal videos
